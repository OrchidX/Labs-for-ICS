# Labs-for-ICS
Five labs of the 2021 version for the Peking University course "Introduction to Computer Systems".

This PKU course originates from Carnegie Mellon University, while these labs are practical assignments matching the textbook "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3/E (CS:APP3e)". However, in the 2021 version, the teaching team of this course at Peking University made some changes to the labs, which made it more difficult to complete these tasks perfectly.

Please note: most of the files need to be opened or run on the Linux system.
